                    Dear Sir/Madam, 
            I'm writing this letter to show interest in Software Development and how I believed in <br>
            the importance of information technology. Since my graduation, I've worked in a variety of domains.<br>
            Such as sales and trade, I've always used to hit the target of the companies I worked with.<br>
            While still considering what I studied at university and how the world business orientation going through.<br>
            My dream is to create my business in IT domain which needs to improve myself and create experience.<br>

            interested in your operations and believe that this will be my first step<br>
